## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was much easier than I thought would be upon initially looking at the design. In this case, I decided to be very rigid about starting with mobile since I don't often do that. It turned out to be for the best. Coding out the design felt very natural, and I never felt like I was going back and forth making tweaks like I do when I start with desktop and work down.

Largely using react, next, and styled-components is overkill, but I really appreciated it at times doing this project. Especially when setting the desktop design's review card padding and margin. I was able to just use the index as a sort of multiplier to set appropriate padding and margin to stagger the components.

### Useful resources

Again sadly, I got nothing here. This project was definitely most similar so far to what I might be asked to build on a regular basis.
